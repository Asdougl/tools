# utils / create-id

Creates a fairly random string that your can use for IDs. The odds of generating the same string twice is pretty far from likely but I wouldn't be using this to drive anything important. Useful for tracking unique things temporarily and client side only, or for optimistic updates when you don't know the actual ID yet.
